## Introduction

Embarking on the `push_swap` project was a fascinating journey into the heart of algorithmic efficiency and stack manipulation. As someone deeply interested in the intricacies of sorting algorithms and data structures, this project offered a unique opportunity to apply theoretical knowledge in a practical setting.

## Understanding Push_Swap

`push_swap` is a custom program designed to sort a stack of integers using a predefined set of operations. The goal is to minimize the number of operations required to sort the stack in ascending order, showcasing the importance of algorithmic optimization in real-world applications.

### Key Operations

- **Swap Stacks**: `sa`, `sb`, `ss` - Swap the top two elements of a stack.
- **Push**: `pa`, `pb` - Move the top element of one stack to another.
- **Rotate**: `ra`, `rb`, `rr` - Rotate the elements of a stack.
- **Reverse Rotate**: `rra`, `rrb`, `rrr` - Reverse rotate the elements of a stack.

### Project Goals

- Sort a stack of integers in ascending order using the minimum number of operations.
- Display the sequence of operations as a string, with each operation separated by a newline character.
- Handle errors gracefully, such as invalid inputs or duplicate numbers.

### Compilation

Utilize a `Makefile` for compiling source files, ensuring no relinking occurs. The `Makefile` should include targets for building, cleaning, and recompiling the project.

### Evaluation Criteria

- **Performance**: The number of operations used to sort the stack should be minimized. Exceeding the maximum allowed operations results in a failing grade.
- **Accuracy**: The sorted stack must match the expected outcome. Any discrepancies result in a failing grade.

### Bonus Part

For those seeking to extend the project, creating a custom checker program to verify the correctness of the sorting algorithm is encouraged. This adds a layer of verification, ensuring the `push_swap` program not only sorts the stack but does so correctly.

## Development Insights

Developing `push_swap` was a testament to the power of systematic problem-solving and the beauty of well-implemented algorithms. Each operation, initially abstract, became a tool in the arsenal of strategies to achieve the goal of sorting. The challenge lay not just in implementing the operations but in devising an efficient strategy to utilize them effectively.
